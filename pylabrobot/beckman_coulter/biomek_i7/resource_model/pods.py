"""Biomek i7 pods and their bridges.

Each pod hangs from a bridge that spans the deck from front to back and rides the X rails; the pod
travels along its bridge in Y, and its head in Z. On this unit pod 1 carries the 96-channel
Multichannel head and pod 2 the Span-8, each with a gripper.

Sized in centimetres. The spans the collision model uses (BridgeXSpan,
BridgeToHeadXOffset, PodXSpan, PodYSpan) are the instrument's own when its declared configuration
is given (`pod_model`), so the model's X extents are the ones the rail guard computes
(`driver/pod_geometry.py`); otherwise the pod type's defaults under
`HardwareSetupInfo/PodTypes/<MC|Span8>`. A value marked `assumed` has no source yet.

Along X, as Biomek's collision model places them: the bridge's left edge is BridgeToHeadXOffset left of the
pipettor's (`bridge_x_range`, `pipettor_x_range` without the avoidance margin), and the pipettor
is the carriage, PodXSpan wide.

A pod is its carriage: its frame is the carriage's front left bottom corner, and it follows the
pod's Y along its bridge. A Multichannel's head (`heads.head96`) hangs below it and follows Z in
it (`place_head96`). The parts with axes of their own are the bridge's: a Span-8's probes
(`heads.span8_channel`, each following its own Y and Z) and the gripper (`gripper_model`, a
`MechanicalGripper` posed from GY, GZ, GR and GG), from which what it holds hangs.
