  the X the rail guard counts. The rest follows the pod's other axes (`_show_pod`): the

  channel its own Y and Z, and the gripper (a `MechanicalGripper`) GY, GZ, GR and GG. The heads
  are the features' resources, so the tips they carry hang from their shafts, as the STAR's do.

  Args:
    deck: the deck. Defaults to the one the declared configuration lays out (`deck_layout`,
      `BiomekI7Deck.from_configuration`), else an empty one (place ALPs with `deck.assign_alp`).
    simulation: drive a simulated instrument instead (`driver/simulator.py`): powered up, not
      configured, not homed. Ignored when a driver is given.
    declared_configuration_json: the instrument's declared configuration (its calibration, axis scales
      and limits, deck positions), as `DeviceConfiguration.from_biomek` makes it from its Biomek
      files, for the driver this builds. Required for the instrument; in simulation, the package's
      generic one when None. Ignored when a driver is given.
    simulator_recording: the cold-start recording a simulated instrument answers identity and
      sensor reads from; `$BIOMEK_I7_SIMULATOR_RECORDING` when None, else the package's generic
      one (`defaults/biomek_i7_generic_coldstart.json`).
    driver: what talks to the instrument, instead of the one this builds.
    name: the resource's name.
    state_json: where the device keeps its tree's state between sessions, the tips on each head
      among it (`BiomekI7Device`'s `state_json`).
    simulate_motion_time: whether a simulated move takes time at all, as the STAR's and the
      Prep's simulators take it: the time the instrument's drives would take (from each move's
      distance, speed and acceleration), so a viewer shows each step. Off, every move answers at
      once.
    motion_time_scale: the share of the instrument's time a move takes when it does: a quarter,
      so a step is watched rather than waited for. 1.0 keeps the instrument's time.

  Two modes, as the STAR's: the instrument (`BiomekI7Driver`, from its own declared
  configuration; nothing is opened until `setup`), or a simulated one (`simulation=True`). A
  simulated instrument given no configuration is the package's generic one (`defaults/`): a
  Biomek i7 with one instrument's physical values, no serial numbers and no measured hysteresis.
  The instrument is never driven from it.
