    each was last set to (`pipettes.set_valves`), at the cutoff velocity last set (an aspirate's

        (`motion.span_targets`), and cannot be given with Y1-Y8.
      speed: 1..1000, Biomek's speed field.
      forces: force limit per axis, in the Master Controller's units (its `SF`; sent x1000). The
        axis stops where that force stalls it (a grip, a tip pressed on); its position is then
        not known until read, which the next move does.
      sensors: per axis, the (sensor, trigger) that stops it where the sensor fires (a Span-8 Z
        sensing liquid). Where it stopped is in the result and becomes the axis's position, as
        the Master Controller keeps it. Whether liquid not sensed or a clot is an
        error is the caller's to decide (the Master Controller fails the `AM` for the first and
