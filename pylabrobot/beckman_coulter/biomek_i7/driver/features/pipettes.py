"""A Span-8 pod's eight independent channels: their syringe pumps, valves, liquid-level sensors and
tip sensor. Reached as `driver.right_pod.pipettes` (on whichever pod is a Span-8).

The channels' axes (Y1-Y8, Z1-Z8, D1-D8) are the pod's, moved through `Pod.move_axes`. The pumps'
valves and cutoff velocity are kept in the pod's state, because every pump move carries them;
this feature is what sets them. The host commands here are the Master Controller's Span-8 ones, as
its logs show them: `CV`, `VI`/`VO`/`VB`/`VE`, `SS`, `GT`, `VT`.

Picking tips up and discarding them are Biomek's compositions of plain moves, as its logs show
them, replayed against every logged one:

- pick up, per set of spots the probes reach in one X/Y/S move (one rack, one X, evenly spaced in
  Y): probe 1 over its spot with the span the spots need; the probes used, and every other probe
  without a tip over an emptied spot of the rack (tip tracking), down to an approach over the rack's top (`AdditionalSafeHeight` +
  `AvoidanceMargin`, Biomek's safe height there, in its world model: by pod 1's corner of the
  position); then pressed in groups (the first probe still waiting and later ones
  at least `MinLoadingInterval` from the last taken, up to `MaxLoadingProbes`: 1+5, 2+6, 3+7, 4+8).
  One move per group at `LoadSpeed` sends the group to the seat (the rack's top + `TipLoadZOffset`
  + the probe's `LoadingOffsets`) and the group before it up to the exit (the top + 1.0 cm); the
  last group then rises alone. `TiploadExitZOffset` and `TipLoadTime` are declared, but no logged
  move depends on either;
- discard: probe 1 at the trash's `XSpan`/2 + `Span8TipDisposalOffsetX`, the probes centred in Y
  ((`YSpan` - span)/2 + `Span8TipDisposalOffsetY`) at the narrowest span, the probes at
  `DiscardHeight` - 1.0 cm; then shucked in groups (the first probe still to go and
  later ones at least `MinUnloadingInterval` from the last taken, up to `MaxUnloadingProbes`): each
  probe of a group driven to the top of its travel + `DiscardOvershoot` at `DiscardSpeed`, where
  the pod's stripper pushes the tip off, and back;
- with `DetectTips` set, the tip sensor then checks the probes worked (`VT`).

Priming fills the pumps and probes with system fluid over the Span-8 wash station, as Biomek's
prime dialog does (the pumps homed, then strokes until the operator stops it), and as logged
(2026-10-09; the same position in four logs): the probes,
without tips, centred in Y at the narrowest span and lowered at speed 250 to the wash position's
height; the pumps homed (`HD`); then strokes, each a full draw with the valves to the system fluid
(`VI`) and a full push out through the probes (`VO`), at the pumps' `D1SpeedLimit` (80.17 % is the
logged 801); when stopped, the probes up and the system trailing air gap drawn at speed 10.
`start_prime` and `stop_prime` are those two halves, for an operator who watches for bubbles;
`prime` runs a set number of strokes.

The stripper works only at the top of travel, so a Span-8 cannot put tips back into a rack: they go
to waste. Carrying probes travel no higher than the top less `DiscardOffset`
(`Pod.traverse_ceilings`). Which probes carry which tips is the session state.
