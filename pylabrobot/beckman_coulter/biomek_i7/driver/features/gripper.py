"""A pod's gripper: the four gripper axes (GY, GG, GZ, GR), on a pod whose declared configuration
describes a gripper. Reached as
`driver.left_x_arm.gripper` / `driver.right_x_arm.gripper`.

The gripper's axes are the pod's: it moves through `Pod.move_axes` with the rest of the pod (a grip
is GG moved force-limited), and what it holds widens the pod's range on the X rail and counts in its
own collision check. This feature moves labware (`pick_up_resource`, `place_resource`,
`move_resource`: the STAR's and the Prep's CoRe-gripper calls, with a `direction` named as STAR's
iSWAP names one), checks
grips, and tells the rail what is held.

A grip, as Biomek's logs have it: travel over the labware with the gripper up and turned to the
grip direction; open; down to the grip height; close force-limited (it stops on the labware); lift
it straight out until it clears what it sat in by Biomek's gripper margin
(`AdditionalSafeHeightGripper` + `AvoidanceMargin`); carry it at the labware's speed; come down
over the destination; open; rise. Where Biomek checks the grip (`AG` / `AU`: the pod's
`SensorEnabled`), it checks before the pickup, after the close, after each move while holding, and
after the release.
