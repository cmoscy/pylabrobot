"""Biomek's pipetting templates ("MC Pipetting", "S8 Pipetting" and their reservoir variants), as a
plan of moves both heads carry out.

Biomek runs an aspirate or dispense as a template: a list of steps whose parameters are bound to
the technique (`=C__Height`, ...). The templates are project data, the same for both heads, and
what follows reproduces every aspirate and dispense Biomek logged:

- aspirate: to 1 mm above the top (100 %; the reservoir variants carry their X offset in this move,
  the Span-8's goes to 10 mm); the leading air gap for a blowout; down to the height (at the
  technique's Z speed); aspirate the volume + the conditioning, the tip following the liquid down
  when asked (`AspirateDelay` after); dispense each conditioning section back (`DispenseDelay` after
  each); the tip touch; up to 1 mm above the top (Z speed); the trailing air gap;
- dispense: to the approach; down to the height; dispense, following the liquid up when asked (or,
  emptying, everything at the starting height); when the well's contents are known, up to 2 mm above
  the liquid (Z speed); the blowout; the tip touch; up to 1 mm above the top (Z speed).

Heights: mm from the bottom, the top (+ the well's depth) or the liquid (+ its level,
refused when the contents are not known), then at least `minimum_height` mm above the bottom. Any
PyLabRobot container works, through PyLabRobot's interface only (`ContainerShape`): the bottom is its
cavity bottom, the level comes from the volume its tracker holds through its
`compute_height_from_volume` (needed only for heights from the liquid and for following, as Biomek
needs known amounts). Following moves the tip by the level's change. A tip touch goes out the given distance in direction theta (Biomek's angle
360 - theta degrees: 90 is -Y) and back; without a distance, to the container's top
outline less the tip's widest radius. (Biomek's own distance, the wall at the touch height less its
tip's cone at the rim, is `labware.biomek_touch_distance`.)

This module plans; it moves nothing. Heights are Biomek's: cm above the deck, of the channel's
bottom (the tip end + the tip's length); volumes are uL in the tip.
