"""Loading tips on a Multichannel head, as the Master Controller does it: `LT`.

The head presses its mandrels into a rack of tips with Z force-limited, so Z stops where the tips
are seated, not at its target. The recipe, as coordinated moves (`Pod.move_axes`):

  1. D to `load_d` at full speed (the plunger where tips are loaded).
  2. Z to `load_z` at `load_speed`, force-limited to `load_force`: Z stops on the tips.
  3. Wait `settling_time` seconds.
  4. Read Z (the press left it unknown): the loaded Z, which `LT` replies.
  5. Z to `relieve_z` at `relieve_speed`, still force-limited, then the same move again with no
     force (Z was force-limited, so it is read first; the drive has eased off a few counts).
  6. Z to `leave_z` and D to `leave_d` together at `leave_speed`.
  7. D to `end_d` at full speed.

Every argument comes from the host; the Master Controller only checks them. Biomek computes them
from the pod's instrument-file settings, the height the tips seat at and how many tips are loaded: `TipLoad.from_configuration`.

As the Master Controller does, the settling wait ends with an error if the interlock trips
(`_settle`).
