"""BiomekI7Driver: finds the instrument's ACE boards, works out what each one is, and owns them.

A Biomek i7 shows up as one USB device per ACE module: the chassis, and one per arm. Which is which
is not fixed by USB order or serial number, so setup opens every ACE device, asks each its module
ID (its type, and an arm's side), and builds the chassis and a pod per arm from the answers. Only one
program can hold an ACE board at a time: Biomek's Master Controller must not be running.

At rest the interlock is tripped: the arms' drives have no motor power, and every CiA 402 drive
reads FAULT. That is how the Master Controller leaves the instrument (its drive supply polls read
off over 90% of the time), so it is not an error here. Bringing the instrument up arms the
interlock and enables every axis, which is each faulted drive's reset, as Biomek does; a fault
that does not clear stops it before anything moves. When anything fails once the interlock is
armed, the driver shows ERROR and trips the interlock; `stop` trips it too, as the Master
Controller's logs show it doing.
