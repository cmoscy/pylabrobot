"""The shared X rail: keeps the two pods from running into each other (design.md B4).

Both pods ride one rail and nothing below the driver stops them colliding: the Master
Controller plans each pod on its own, and each board knows only its pod. Biomek keeps them
apart. Before a pod moves, its swept range must clear the other pod's
range; if it does not, the other pod is moved out of the way first and the mover waits. A pod's
range counts its bridge, its pipettor and its gripper, turned and opened as it is, with what it
holds (`driver/pod_geometry.py`).

`XRail` applies the same rule. It differs in three ways:
- **It refuses** a move into where the other pod stands, or will stand once its move ends,
  rather than moving the other pod; `make_space` comes later.
- **It waits** when a move conflicts only with a move of the other pod still running, then
  checks again: the other pod is passing through, not staying (Biomek runs such moves together).
- **It reserves** every move in flight, so two moves started together cannot pass through each
  other.

It works from the declared configuration (`driver/configuration.py`), never from the resource
tree, so it holds with no deck. Poses are in Biomek's units: deck X in cm, GR in degrees, GG in cm.
